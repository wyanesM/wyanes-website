\## Transforming Data into Financial Strategy

I am a highly organized Finance Professional with over \*\*10 years of experience\*\* bridging the gap between traditional \*\*Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A)\*\* and modern \*\*Data Science\*\*.

My expertise lies in building robust financial models, ensuring internal controls (SOX/IFRS), and leveraging predictive modeling to drive strategic decision-making.
